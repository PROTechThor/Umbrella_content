## Thanks for your interest in translating Umbrella!

Umbrella is approximately 81,000 words and growing, so trying to manage and translate it is a tricky process. We rely on your help.

##Let’s not reinvent the wheel! 
A lot of the content we have used in Umbrella, especially digital security topics, borrows heavily from the following excellent guides – which have been re-written slightly and modified to fit into a mobile app. Many of these already have translations! Though much of our physical and operational security content has never been translated before!

Tactical Technology/Frontline Defenders [Security in a Box] (https://securityinabox.org) - has been translated into 15 languages. Electronic Frontier Foundation
[Surveillance Self Defence](https://ssd.eff.org) - has been translated into 11 languages.

Please look as these projects to see if translations already exist. If these projects are full, or partial translations of these tools already, please avoid duplication of work by integrating them into your translation submissions. 

While we don’t want to waste time, it’s important to include these in your translation submissions also, as our developers don’t speak all the various languages, so it is hard for them to pull in already existing languages directly themselves.

##Priorities 
Our priorities for translation are the things which are completely new, you can see our priority list [here] (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5JqSykBSx2iPCme91bu8RVj5j6EsOScHBJQNd_HGBk/edit?usp=sharing).


##Please don't break 
Throughout the content for translation you may see slightly strange thinks link this:

 "img src=mobile1.png" 
 
 and this 
 
 "a href="umbrella://lesson/making-a-call"

These are internal links. Please don’t translate or break them (by adding extra characters etc). These are internal links used for navigation around the Umbrella. If they are broken then users often get error screens. 

If you notice anything broken or which needs to be updated, please make an issue on our [Content Github] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/issues) or drop us a mail to info@secfirst.org.

##Transifex 
The easiest method of translation through our [Transifex account] (https://www.transifex.com/otf/umbrella-app/dashboard/). Our awesome friends over the [Localization Lab] (http://www.localizationlab.org/)  help manage a group of volunteer translators for Umbrella and other open source projects through it. You setup an account and then contribute by translating individual strings. You can find a guide to getting started as a translator [here] (http://docs.transifex.com/getting-started/translators/).

##GitHub 
If you prefer to work with a Github workflow. We have our English content available here in different formats. The app uses .JSON files so they or Markdown .MD are the easiest for us to work with. You can access them here: [.json] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/json/en), Word [.doc] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/doc/en), Open Document [.odt] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/odt/en) and [HTML] (https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_content/tree/master/html/en).

##Thanks 
Thanks so much for your work. We care about your privacy but would also like to thank you for your work in Umbrella. If your ok with that, please let us know and we can add your name to the "Thank You" part of the "About" section. If you see us in person, we owe you a beer or coffee :)
